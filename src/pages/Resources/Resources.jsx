        <h1>What is Journaling</h1>
        <p>Journaling generally involves the practice of keeping a diary or journal that explores thoughts and feelings surrounding the events of your life. There are several different ways to do this. Journaling, as a stress management and self-exploration tool, works best when done consistently, but even occasional, sporadic journaling can be stress relieving when the practice is focused on gratitude or emotional processing.</p>

        <h1>What Should I Write</h1>
        <p>Sometimes it can seem daunting to think of a meaningful topic to write about. At Presence we take some of the pressure of figuring out what to write off of you by providing daily prompts to promote thought and self-reflection, but don't feel the need to journal solely in line with our daily prompts. Ulitamtely no topic is too big or too small to get you started. Write about your goals, what you did today, things that you're grateful for; anything that comes to mind can be a great place to start a session.</p>
